  <title>Web Service Transaction Service (XTS) Management</title>
  <para>
    The basic building blocks of a transactional Web Services application include the application itself, the Web
    services that the application consumes, the Transaction Manager, and the transaction participants which support
    those Web services. Although it is likely that different developers will be responsible for each piece, the concepts
    are presented here so that you can see the whole picture. Often, developers produce services, or applications that
    consume services, and system administrators run the transaction-management infrastructure.
  </para>
  
  <section>
    <title>Transaction manager overview</title>
    <para>
      The transaction manager is a Web service which coordinates JBossTS transactions. It is the only software component
      in JBossTS that is designed to be run directly as a network service, rather than to support end-user code. The
      transaction manager runs as a JAXM request/response Web service.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        When starting up an application server instance that has JBossTS transaction manager deployed within it, you may
        see various “error” messages in the console or log. For example 16:53:38,850 ERROR [STDERR] Message Listener
        Service: started, message listener jndi name activationcoordinator". These are for information purposes only and
        are not actual errors.

  <section>
    <title>Configuring the transaction manager</title>
    <para>
      You can configure the Transaction Manager and related infrastructure by using two properties files.
      The <filename>standalone-xts.xml</filename> file contains the common configuration options. More advanced options
      can be configured in the <filename>xts-properties.xml</filename>.
    </para>
    <note>
        The XTS module (<filename>modules/system/layers/base/org/jboss/xts/main/jbossxts-${XTS_VERSION}.jar</filename>)
        in the &APPSERVER; includes the configuration file,
        <filename>xts-properties.xml</filename>, in the root of the jar. These properties can be edited and then
        re-packaged in the jar. The changes will take affect on next boot of the  &APPSERVER;.
    </note>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Deployment descriptors</title>
    <para>
      In general, changing the contents of the various deployment descriptors used by JBossTS is not necessary. However,
      if you do need to modify them they are all included in <filename>modules/system/layers/base/org/jboss/xts/main/jbossxts-${XTS_VERSION}.jar</filename>.
