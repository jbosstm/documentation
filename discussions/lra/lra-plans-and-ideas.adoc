= Narayana LRA - research and development ideas

This document aims to gather ideas on future research and development for Narayana LRA implementation
(particularly when LRA 1.0 is out).
This is meant to be a living document for brainstorming and further discussions in the team.
Feel free to add your points, create PR and discuss.

== Research and development ideas

== HA LRA

Longer standing goal to make LRA more cloud native. First there is need to clarify what should be the design approach.

== Messaging protocols

It would be good to work not just with the HTTP (REST API) but being able to communicate first over new point-to-point protocols (e.g. gRPC) and second with async message broker “bus” (e.g. Apache Kafka).

== Integration with Debezium

The Debezium project comes with a proof of concept of saga pattern on top of the outbox pattern. It would be good to integrate the effort with LRA.

== Serverless LRA

Integration with Funqy in quarkus to provide a way for serverless functions to be plugged into LRA processing.
