== Failure Recovery

In this chapter we shall cover information on failure recovery that is specific to ArjunaCore, TXOJ, or using {productName} outside the scope of a supported application server.

=== Embedding the Recovery Manager

In some situations it may be required to embed the `RecoveryManager` in the same process as the transaction service.
In this case you can create an instance of the `RecoveryManager` through the manager method on `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.RecoveryManager`.
A `RecoveryManager` can be created in one of two modes, selected via the parameter to the manager method:

* `INDIRECT_MANAGEMENT`: the manager runs periodically but can also be instructed to run when desired via the scan operation or through the RecoveryDriver class to be described below.
* `DIRECT_MANAGEMENT`: the manager does not run periodically and must be driven directly via the scan operation or RecoveryDriver.

[WARNING]
====
By default, the recovery manager listens on the first available port on a given machine.
If you wish to control the port number that it uses, you can specify this using the `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.recoveryPort` attribute.
====

==== Additional Recovery Module Classes

{productName} provides a set of recovery modules that are responsible to manage recovery according to the nature of the participant and its position in a transactional tree.
The provided classes over and above the ones covered elsewhere (that all implements the RecoveryModule interface) are:

* `com.arjuna.ats.internal.txoj.recovery.TORecoveryModule`
* Recovers Transactional Objects for Java.

=== Understanding Recovery Modules

The failure recovery subsystem of {productName} will ensure that results of a transaction are applied consistently to all resources affected by the transaction, even if any of the application processes or the machine hosting them crash or lose network connectivity.
In the case of machine (system) crash or network failure, the recovery will not take place until the system or network are restored, but the original application does not need to be restarted – recovery responsibility is delegated to the Recovery Manager process (see below).
Recovery after failure requires that information about the transaction and the resources involved survives the failure and is accessible afterward: this information is held in the ActionStore, which is part of the `ObjectStore`.

[WARNING]
====
If the `ObjectStore` is destroyed or modified, recovery may not be possible.
====

Until the recovery procedures are complete, resources affected by a transaction that was in progress at the time of the failure may be inaccessible.
For database resources, this may be reported as tables or rows held by “in-doubt transactions”.
For TransactionalObjects for Java resources, an attempt to activate the Transactional Object (as when trying to get a lock) will fail.

==== The Recovery Manager

The failure recovery subsystem of {productName} requires that the stand-alone Recovery Manager process be running for each `ObjectStore` (typically one for each node on the network that is running {productName} applications).
The `RecoveryManager` file is located in the package `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.RecoveryManager`.
To start the Recovery Manager issue the following command:

====
[source,shell]
----
java com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.RecoveryManager
----

If the -test flag is used with the Recovery Manager then it will display a “Ready” message when initialised, i.e.:

[source,shell]
----
java com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.RecoveryManager -test
----
====

==== Configuring the Recovery Manager

The `RecoveryManager` reads the properties defined in the arjuna.properties file and then also reads the property file `RecoveryManager.properties`, from the same directory as it found the arjuna properties file.
An entry for a property in the `RecoveryManager` properties file will override an entry for the same property in the main TransactionService properties file.
Most of the entries are specific to the Recovery Manager.

A default version of `RecoveryManager.properties` is supplied with the distribution – this can be used without modification, except possibly the debug tracing fields (see below, Output).
The rest of this section discusses the issues relevant in setting the properties to other values (in the order of their appearance in the default version of the file).

==== Periodic Recovery

The `RecoveryManager` scans the `ObjectStore` and other locations of information, looking for transactions and resources that require, or may require recovery.
The scans and recovery processing are performed by recovery modules, (instances of classes that implement the `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.RecoveryModule` interface), each with responsibility for a particular category of transaction or resource.
The set of recovery modules used are dynamically loaded, using properties found in the `RecoveryManager` property file.

The interface has two methods: `periodicWorkFirstPass` and `periodicWorkSecondPass`.
At an interval (defined by property `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.periodicRecoveryPeriod`), the `RecoveryManager` will call the first pass method on each property, then wait for a brief period (defined by property `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.recoveryBackoffPeriod`), then call the second pass of each module.
Typically, in the first pass, the module scans (e.g. the relevant part of the `ObjectStore`) to find transactions or resources that are in-doubt (i.e. are part way through the commitment process).
On the second pass, if any of the same items are still in-doubt, it is possible the original application process has crashed and the item is a candidate for recovery.

An attempt, by the `RecoveryManager`, to recover a transaction that is still progressing in the original process(es) is likely to break the consistency.
Accordingly, the recovery modules use a mechanism (implemented in the `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.TransactionStatusManager` package) to check to see if the original process is still alive, and if the transaction is still in progress.
The `RecoveryManager` only proceeds with recovery if the original process has gone, or, if still alive, the transaction is completed.
(If a server process or machine crashes, but the transaction-initiating process survives, the transaction will complete, usually generating a warning.
Recovery of such a transaction is the `RecoveryManager`’s responsibility).

It is clearly important to set the interval periods appropriately.
The total iteration time will be the sum of the `periodicRecoveryPeriod`, `recoveryBackoffPeriod` and the length of time it takes to scan the stores and to attempt recovery of any in-doubt transactions found, for all the recovery modules.
The recovery attempt time may include connection timeouts while trying to communicate with processes or machines that have crashed or are inaccessible (which is why there are mechanisms in the recovery system to avoid trying to recover the same transaction forever).
The total iteration time will affect how long a resource will remain inaccessible after a failure – `periodicRecoveryPeriod` should be set accordingly (default is 120 seconds).
The `recoveryBackoffPeriod` can be comparatively short (default is 10 seconds) – its purpose is mainly to reduce the number of transactions that are candidates for recovery and which thus require a “call to the original process to see if they are still in progress

[NOTE]
====
In previous versions of {productName} there was no contact mechanism, and the backoff period had to be long enough to avoid catching transactions in flight at all.
From 3.0, there is no such risk.
====

Two recovery modules (implementations of the `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.RecoveryModule` interface) are supplied with {productName}, supporting various aspects of transaction recovery including JDBC recovery.
It is possible for advanced users to create their own recovery modules and register them with the Recovery Manager.
The recovery modules are registered with the `RecoveryManager` using `RecoveryEnvironmentBean.recoveryExtensions`.
These will be invoked on each pass of the periodic recovery in the sort-order of the property names – it is thus possible to predict the ordering (but note that a failure in an application process might occur while a periodic recovery pass is in progress).
The default Recovery Extension settings are:

  com.arjuna.ats.internal.arjuna.recovery.AtomicActionRecoveryModule
  com.arjuna.ats.internal.txoj.recovery.TORecoveryModule
</entry>

----
====

==== Expired entry removal

The operation of the recovery subsystem will cause some entries to be made in the `ObjectStore` that will not be removed in normal progress.
The RecoveryManager has a facility for scanning for these and removing items that are very old.
Scans and removals are performed by implementations of the `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.ExpiryScanner` interface.
Implementations of this interface are loaded by giving the class names as the value of a property `RecoveryEnvironmentBean.expiryScanners`.
The `RecoveryManager` calls the `scan()` method on each loaded Expiry Scanner implementation at an interval determined by the property `RecoveryEnvironmentBean.expiryScanInterval`”.
This value is given in hours – default is 12. An expiryScanInterval value of zero will suppress any expiry scanning.
If the value as supplied is positive, the first scan is performed when `RecoveryManager` starts; if the value is negative, the first scan is delayed until after the first interval (using the absolute value)

The kinds of item that are scanned for expiry are:

`TransactionStatusManager` items::
one of these is created by every application process that uses {productName} – they contain the information that allows the `RecoveryManager` to determine if the process that initiated the transaction is still alive, and what the transaction status is.
The expiry time for these is set by the property `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.transactionStatusManagerExpiryTime` (in hours – default is 12, zero means never expire).
The expiry time should be greater than the lifetime of any single {productName}-using process.

The Expiry Scanner properties for these are:

To illustrate the behavior of a recovery module, the following pseudo code describes the basic algorithm used for Atomic Action transactions and Transactional Objects for java.

First Pass:
< create a collection containing all transactions currently in the log >

Second Pass:
while < there are transactions in the collection >
do
 if < the intention list for the transaction still exists >
 then
   < create new transaction cached item >
   < obtain the status of the transaction >

   if < the transaction is not in progress (ie phase 2 has finished ) >
   then
     < replay phase two of the commit protocol >
   endif.
 endif.
end while.

.Transactional Object pseudo code

First Pass:
< Create a hash table for uncommitted transactional objects. >
< Read in all transactional objects within the object store. >

do
   if < the transactional object has an Uncommited status in the object store >
   then
      < add the transactional Object o the hash table for uncommitted transactional objects>
   end if.
end while.

Second Pass:
while < there are transactions in the hash table for uncommitted transactional objects >
do
   if < the transaction is still in the Uncommitted state >
   then
      if < the transaction is not in the Transaction Cache >
      then
         < check the status of the transaction with the original application process >
         if < the status is Rolled Back or the application process is inactive >
            < rollback the transaction by removing the Uncommitted status from the Object Store >
         endif.
      endif.
   endif.
end while.

=== Writing a Recovery Module

In order to recover from failure, we have seen that the Recovery Manager contacts recovery modules by invoking periodically the methods `periodicWorkFirstPass` and `periodicWorkSecondPass`.
Each Recovery Module is then able to manage recovery according the type of resources that need to be recovered.
The {productName} product is shipped with a set of recovery modules (`TOReceveryModule`, `XARecoveryModule`…), but it is possible for a user to define its own recovery module that fit his application.
The following basic example illustrates the steps needed to build such recovery module

==== A basic scenario

This basic example does not aim to present a complete process to recover from failure, but mainly to illustrate the way to implement a recovery module.

The application used here consists to create an atomic transaction, to register a participant within the created transaction and finally to terminate it either by commit or abort.
A set of arguments are provided:

* to decide to commit or abort the transaction,
* to decide generating a crash during the commitment process.

The code of the main class that control the application is given below:

.TestRecoveryModule.java
====
[source,Java]
----
package com.arjuna.demo.recoverymodule;

import com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.AtomicAction;
import com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.*;

public class TestRecoveryModule {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		try {
			AtomicAction tx = new AtomicAction();
            // Top level begin
			tx.begin();

			// enlist the participant
			tx.add(SimpleRecord.create());

			System.out.println("About to complete the transaction ");
			for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
				if ((args[i].compareTo("-commit") == 0))
					_commit = true;
				if ((args[i].compareTo("-rollback") == 0))
					_commit = false;
				if ((args[i].compareTo("-crash") == 0))
					_crash = true;
			}
			if (_commit)
                // Top level commit
				tx.commit();
			else
                // Top level rollback
				tx.abort();
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}

	protected static boolean _commit = true;
	protected static boolean _crash = false;
}

----
====

The registered participant has the following behavior:

* During the prepare phase, it writes a simple message - “I’m prepared”- on the disk such The message is written in a well known file
* During the commit phase, it writes another message - “I’m committed”- in the same file used during prepare
* If it receives an abort message, it removes from the disk the file used for prepare if any.
* If a crash has been decided for the test, then it crashes during the commit phase – the file remains with the message “I’m prepared”.

The main portion of the code illustrating such behavior is described hereafter.

The location of the file given in variable filename can be changed

.SimpleRecord.java

package com.arjuna.demo.recoverymodule;

import com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.*;
import java.io.File;

public class SimpleRecord extends AbstractRecord {
	public String filename = "c:/tmp/RecordState";

	public SimpleRecord() {
		System.out.println("Creating new resource");
	}

	public static AbstractRecord create() {
		return new SimpleRecord();
	}

	public int topLevelAbort() {
		try {
			File fd = new File(filename);
			if (fd.exists()) {
				if (fd.delete())
					System.out.println("File Deleted");
			}
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			// …
		}
		return TwoPhaseOutcome.FINISH_OK;
	}

	public int topLevelCommit() {
		if (TestRecoveryModule._crash)
			System.exit(0);
		try {
			java.io.FileOutputStream file = new java.io.FileOutputStream(
					filename);
			java.io.PrintStream pfile = new java.io.PrintStream(
					file);
			pfile.println("I'm Committed");
			file.close();
		} catch (java.io.IOException ex) {
			// ...
		}
		return TwoPhaseOutcome.FINISH_OK;
	}

	public int topLevelPrepare() {
		try {
			java.io.FileOutputStream file = new java.io.FileOutputStream(
					filename);
			java.io.PrintStream pfile = new java.io.PrintStream(
					file);

			file.close();
		} catch (java.io.IOException ex) {
			// ...
		}
		return TwoPhaseOutcome.PREPARE_OK;
	}
	// …
}

The role of the Recovery Module in such application consists to read the content of the file used to store the status of the participant, to determine that status and print a message indicating if a recovery action is needed or not.

.SimpleRecoveryModule.java

package com.arjuna.demo.recoverymodule;

import com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.RecoveryModule;

public class SimpleRecoveryModule implements RecoveryModule {
	public String filename = "c:/tmp/RecordState";

	public SimpleRecoveryModule() {
		System.out
				.println("The SimpleRecoveryModule is loaded");
	}

	public void periodicWorkFirstPass() {
		try {
			java.io.FileInputStream file = new java.io.FileInputStream(
					filename);
			java.io.InputStreamReader input = new java.io.InputStreamReader(
					file);
			java.io.BufferedReader reader = new java.io.BufferedReader(
					input);
			String stringState = reader.readLine();
			if (stringState.compareTo("I'm prepared") == 0)
				System.out
						.println("The transaction is in the prepared state");
			file.close();
		} catch (java.io.IOException ex) {
			System.out.println("Nothing found on the Disk");
		}
	}

	public void periodicWorkSecondPass() {
		try {
			java.io.FileInputStream file = new java.io.FileInputStream(
					filename);
			java.io.InputStreamReader input = new java.io.InputStreamReader(
					file);
			java.io.BufferedReader reader = new java.io.BufferedReader(
					input);
			String stringState = reader.readLine();
			if (stringState.compareTo("I'm prepared") == 0) {
				System.out
						.println("The record is still in the prepared state");
				System.out.println("– Recovery is needed");
			} else if (stringState
					.compareTo("I'm Committed") == 0) {
				System.out
						.println("The transaction has completed and committed");
			}
			file.close();
		} catch (java.io.IOException ex) {
			System.out.println("Nothing found on the Disk");
			System.out
					.println("Either there was no transaction");
			System.out.println("or it as been rolled back");
		}
	}
}

====

The recovery module should now be deployed in order to be called by the Recovery Manager.
To do so, we just need to add an entry in the config file for the extension:

.Recovery Environment Bean Recovery Extensions XML
====
[source,XML]
----
<entry key="RecoveryEnvironmentBean.recoveryExtenstions">
  com.arjuna.demo.recoverymodule.SimpleRecoveryModule
</entry>

Once started, the Recovery Manager will automatically load the listed Recovery modules.

[NOTE]
====
The source of the code can be retrieved under the trailmap directory of the {productName} installation.
====

==== Another scenario

As mentioned, the basic application presented above does not present the complete process to recover from failure, but it was just presented to describe how the build a recovery module.
In case of the OTS protocol, let’s consider how a recovery module that manages recovery of OTS resources can be configured.

To manage recovery in case of failure, the OTS specification has defined a recovery protocol.
Transaction’s participants in a doubt status could use the `RecoveryCoordinator` to determine the status of the transaction.
According to that transaction status, those participants can take appropriate decision either by roll backing or committing.
Asking the `RecoveryCoordinator` object to determine the status consists of invoke the `replay_completion` operation on the `RecoveryCoordinator`.

For each OTS Resource in a doubt status, it is well known which RecoveyCoordinator to invoke to determine the status of the transaction in which the Resource is involved – It’s the `RecoveryCoordinator` returned during the Resource registration process.
Retrieving such `RecoveryCoordinator` per resource means that it has been stored in addition to other information describing the resource.

A recovery module dedicated to recover OTS Resources could have the following behavior.
When requested by the recovery Manager on the first pass it retrieves from the disk the list of resources that are in the doubt status.
During the second pass, if the resources that were retrieved in the first pass still remain in the disk then they are considered as candidates for recovery.
Therefore, the Recovery Module retrieves for each candidate its associated `RecoveryCoordinator` and invokes the replay_completion operation that the status of the transaction.
According to the returned status, an appropriate action would be taken (for instance, rollback the resource is the status is aborted or inactive).
