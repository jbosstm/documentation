== Constructing an OTS application

=== Important notes for {parentProduct}

==== Initialization

{parentProduct} must be correctly initialized before you create any application object.
To guarantee this, use the `initORB` and POA methods described in the _Orb Portability Guide_.
Consult _the Orb Portability Guide_ if you need direct use of the `ORB_init` and `create_POA` methods provided by the underlying ORB.

==== Implicit context propagation and interposition

If you need implicit context propagation and interposition, initialize {parentProduct} correctly before you create any objects.
You can only use implicit context propagation on an ORB which supports filters and interceptors, or the `CosTSPortability` interface.
You can set `OTS_CONTEXT_PROP_MODE` to `CONTEXT` or `INTERPOSITION`, depending on which functionality you need.
If you are using the {parentProduct} API, you need to use interposition.

=== Writing applications using the raw OTS interfaces

* Create `Resource` and `SubtransactionAwareResource` objects for each object which will participate within the transaction or sub-transaction.
These resources manage the persistence, concurrency control, and recovery for the object.
The OTS invokes these objects during the prepare, commit, or abort phase of the transaction or sub-transaction, and the Resources perform the work of the application.
* Register `Resource` and `SubtransactionAwareResource` objects at the correct time within the transaction, and ensure that the object is only registered once within a given transaction.
As part of registration, a `Resource` receives a reference to a `RecoveryCoordinator`.
This reference must be made persistent, so that the transaction can recover in the event of a failure.
* Correctly propagate resources such as locks to parent transactions and `SubtransactionAwareResource` objects.
* Drive the crash recovery for each resource which was participating within the transaction, in the event of a failure.

The OTS does not provide any `Resource` implementations.
You need to provide these implementations.
The interfaces defined within the OTS specification are too low-level for most situations. {parentProduct} is designed to make use of raw _Common Object Services (COS)_ interfaces, but provides a higher-level API for building transactional applications and framework.
This API automates much of the work involved with participating in an OTS transaction.

=== Transaction context management

If you use implicit transaction propagation, ensure that appropriate objects support the `TransactionalObject` interface.
Otherwise, you need to pass the transaction contexts as parameters to the relevant operations.

A transaction originator uses indirect context management and implicit transaction propagation.
`txn_crt` is a pseudo object supporting the `Current` interface.
The client uses the `begin` operation to start the transaction, which becomes implicitly associated with the originator’s thread of control.

The program commits the transaction associated with the client thread.
The `report_heuristics` argument is set to `false`, so the Transaction Service makes no reports about possible heuristic decisions.

    pgtx = c.get_coordinator().get_txcontext();

----
====

This transaction originator uses direct context management and explicit transaction propagation.
The client uses a factory object supporting the `CosTransactions::TransactionFactory` interface to create a new transaction, and uses the returned `Control` object to retrieve the `Terminator` and `Coordinator` objects.

The client issues requests, some of which involve transactional objects.
This example uses explicit propagation of the context.
The `Control` object reference is passed as an explicit parameter of the request.
It is declared in the OMG IDL of the interface.

=== Implementing a transactional client

The `commit` operation of `Current` or the `Terminator` interface takes the `boolean` `report_heuristics` parameter.
If the `report_heuristics` argument is `false`, the commit operation can complete as soon as the `Coordinator` makes the decision to commit or roll back the transaction.
The application does not need to wait for the `Coordinator` to complete the commit protocol by informing all the participants of the outcome of the transaction.
This can significantly reduce the elapsed time for the commit operation, especially where participant `Resource` objects are located on remote network nodes.
However, no heuristic conditions can be reported to the application in this case.

Using the `report_heuristics` option guarantees that the commit operation does not complete until the `Coordinator` completes the commit protocol with all `Resource` objects involved in the transaction.
This guarantees that the application is informed of any non-atomic outcomes of the transaction, through one of the exceptions `HeuristicMixed` or `HeuristicHazard`.
However, it increases the application-perceived elapsed time for the commit operation.

=== Implementing a recoverable server

A Recoverable Server includes at least one transactional object and one resource object, each of which have distinct responsibilities.

==== Transactional object

The transactional object implements the transactional object's operations and registers a `Resource` object with the `Coordinator`, so that the Recoverable Server's resources, including any necessary recovery, can commit.

The `Resource` object identifies the involvement of the Recoverable Server in a particular transaction.
This requires a `Resource` object to only be registered in one transaction at a time.
Register a different `Resource` object for each transaction in which a recoverable server is concurrently involved.
A transactional object may receive multiple requests within the scope of a single transaction.
It only needs to register its involvement in the transaction once.
The `is_same_transaction` operation allows the transactional object to determine if the transaction associated with the request is one in which the transactional object is already registered.

The `hash_transaction` operations allow the transactional object to reduce the number of transaction comparisons it has to make.
All `Coordinators` for the same transaction return the same hash code.
The `is_same_transaction` operation only needs to be called on `Coordinators` with the same hash code as the `Coordinator` of the current request.

==== Resource object

A `Resource` object participates in the completion of the transaction, updates the resources of the Recoverable Server in accordance with the transaction outcome, and ensures termination of the transaction, including across failures.

==== Reliable servers

A _Reliable Server_ is a special case of a Recoverable Server.
A Reliable Server can use the same interface as a Recoverable Server to ensure application integrity for objects that do not have recoverable state.
In the case of a Reliable Server, the transactional object can register a `Resource` object that replies `VoteReadOnly` to `prepare` if its integrity constraints are satisfied.
It replies `VoteRollback` if it finds a problem.
This approach allows the server to apply integrity constraints which apply to the transaction as a whole, rather than to individual requests to the server.

=== Failure models

The Transaction Service provides atomic outcomes for transactions in the presence of application, system or communication failures.
From the viewpoint of each user object role, two types of failure are relevant:

* A local failure, which affects the object itself.
* An external failure, such as failure of another object or failure in the communication with an object.

The transaction originator and transactional server handle these failures in different ways.

==== Transaction originator

Local failure::
If a Transaction originator fails before the originator issues `commit`, the transaction is rolled back.
If the originator fails after issuing commit and before the outcome is reported, the transaction can either commit or roll back, depending on timing.
In this case, the transaction completes without regard to the failure of the originator.
External failure::
Any external failure which affects the transaction before the originator issues `commit` causes the transaction to roll back.
The standard exception `TransactionRolledBack` is raised in the originator when it issues `commit`.
+
If a failure occurs after commit and before the outcome is reported, the client may not be informed of the outcome of the transaction.
This depends on the nature of the failure, and the use of the `report_heuristics` option of `commit`.
For example, the transaction outcome is not reported to the client if communication between the client and the `Coordinator` fails.
+
A client can determine the outcome of the transaction by using method `get_status` on the `Coordinator`.
However, this is not reliable because it may return the status `NoTransaction`, which is ambiguous.
The transaction could have committed and been forgotten, or it could have rolled back and been forgotten.
+
An originator is only guaranteed to know the transaction outcome in one of two ways.
+
* if its implementation includes a `Resource` object, so that it can participate in the two-phase commit procedure.
* The originator and `Coordinator` must be located in the same failure domain.

==== Transactional server

Local failure::
If the Transactional Server fails, optional checks by a Transaction Service implementation may make the transaction to roll back.
Without such checks, whether the transaction rolls back depends on whether the commit decision is already made, such as when an unchecked client invokes `commit` before receiving all replies from servers.
External failure::
Any external failure affecting the transaction during the execution of a Transactional Server causes the transaction to be rolled back.
If the failure occurs while the transactional object’s method is executing, the failure has no effect on the execution of this method.
The method may terminate normally, returning the reply to its client.
Eventually the `TransactionRolledBack` exception is returned to a client issuing `commit`.
Recoverable server::
Behavior of a recoverable server when failures occur is determined by the two phase commit protocol between the `Coordinator` and the recoverable server’s `Resource` object.

=== Summary

When you develop OTS applications which use the raw OTS interfaces, be aware of the following items:

* Create `Resource` and `SubtransactionAwareResource` objects for each object which will participate within the transaction or sub-transaction.
These resources handle the persistence, concurrency control, and recovery for the object.
The OTS invokes these objects during the prepare, commit, and abort phases of the transaction or sub-transaction, and the `Resources` then perform all appropriate work.
* Register `Resource` and `SubtransactionAwareResource` objects at the correct time within the transaction, and ensure that the object is only registered once within a given transaction.
As part of registration, a `Resource` receives a reference to a `RecoveryCoordinator`, which must be made persistent so that recovery can occur in the event of a failure.
* For nested transactions, make sure that any propagation of resources, such as locks to parent transactions, are done correctly.
You also need to manage propagation of `SubtransactionAwareResource` objects to parents.
* in the event of failures, drive the crash recovery for each `Resource` which participates within the transaction.

The OTS does not provide any `Resource` implementations.
