= {parentProduct} interfaces for extending the OTS

This chapter contains a description of the use of the {parentProduct} classes you can use to extend the OTS interfaces.
These advanced interfaces are all written on top of the basic OTS engine described previously, and applications which use them run on other OTS implementations, only without the added functionality.

.Features
AtomicTransaction::
Provides a more manageable interface to the OTS transaction than `CosTransactions::Current`. It automatically keeps track of transaction scope, and allows you to create nested top-level transactions in a more natural manner than the one provided by the OTS.

Advanced subtransaction-Resource classes::
Allow nested transactions to use a two-phase commit protocol.
These Resources can also be ordered within {parentProduct}, enabling you to control the order in which `Resource` s are called during the commit or abort protocol.

Implicit context propagation between client and server::
Where available, {parentProduct} uses implicit context propagation between client and server.
Otherwise, {parentProduct} provides an explicit interposition class, which simplifies the work involved in interposition.
The {parentProduct} API, _Transactional Objects for Java (TXOJ)_, requires either explicit or implicit interposition.
This is even true in a stand-alone mode when using a separate transaction manager.
TXOJ is fully described in the _ArjunaCore Development Guide_.

the extensions to the `CosTransactions.idl` are located in the `com.arjuna.ArjunaOTS` package and the `ArjunaOTS.idl` file.

== Nested transactions

The OTS implementation of nested transactions is extremely limited, and can lead to the generation of inconsistent results.
One example is a scenario in which a sub-transaction coordinator discovers part of the way through committing that a resources cannot commit.
It may not be able to tell the committed resources to abort.

In most transactional systems which support sub-transactions, the sub-transaction commit protocol is the same as a top-level transaction’s.
There are two phases, a `prepare` phase and a `commit` or `abort` phase.
Using a multi-phase commit protocol avoids the above problem of discovering that one resources cannot commit after others have already been told to commit.
The `prepare` phase generates consensus on the commit outcome, and the `commit` or `abort` phase enforces the outcome.

{parentProduct} supports the strict OTS implementation of sub-transactions for those resources derived from `CosTransactions::SubtransactionAwareResource`.
However, if a resource is derived from `ArjunaOTS::ArjunaSubtranAwareResource`, it is driven by a two-phase commit protocol whenever a nested transaction commits.

.ArjunaSubtranAwareResource
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/extras/ArjunaSubtranAwareResource.java[]
----
====

During the first phase of the commit protocol the `prepare_subtransaction` method is called, and the resource behaves as though it were being driven by a top-level transaction, making any state changes provisional upon the second phase of the protocol.
Any changes to persistent state must still be provisional upon the second phase of the top-level transaction, as well.
Based on the votes of all registered resources, {parentProduct} then calls either `commit_subtransaction` or `rollback_subtransaction`.

[NOTE]
====
This scheme only works successfully if all resources registered within a given sub-transaction are instances of the `ArjunaSubtranAwareResource` interface, and that after a resource tells the coordinator it can prepare, it does not change its mind.
====

== Extended resources

When resources are registered with a transaction, the transaction maintains them within a list, called the _intentions list_.
At termination time, the transaction uses the intentions list to drive each resource appropriately, to commit or abort.
However, you have no control over the order in which resources are called, or whether previously-registered resources should be replaced with newly registered resources.
The {parentProduct} interface `ArjunaOTS::OTSAbstractRecord` gives you this level of control.

.OTSAbstractRecord

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|`typeId` |returns the record type of the instance. This is one of the values of the enumerated type `Record_type`.
|`uid` |a stringified Uid for this record.
|`propagateOnAbort` |by default, instances of `OTSAbstractRecord` should not be propagated to the parent transaction if the current transaction rolls back. By returning `TRUE`, the instance will be propagated.
|`propagateOnCommit` |returning `TRUE` from this method causes the instance to be propagated to the parent transaction if the current transaction commits. Returning `FALSE` disables the propagation.
|`saveRecord` |returning `TRUE` from this method causes {parentProduct} to try to save sufficient information about the record to persistent state during commit, so that crash recovery mechanisms can replay the transaction termination in the event of a failure. If `FALSE` is returned, no information is saved.
|`merge` |used when two records need to merge together.
|`alter` |used when a record should be altered.
|`shouldAdd` |returns `true` ii the record should be added to the list, `false` if it should be discarded.
|`shouldMerge` |returns `true` if the two records should be merged into a single record, `false` otherwise.
|`shouldReplace` |returns `true` if the record should replace an existing one, `false` otherwise.
|===

When inserting a new record into the transaction’s intentions list, {parentProduct} uses the following algorithm:

. if a record with the same type and uid has already been inserted, then the methods `shouldAdd`, and related methods, are invoked to determine whether this record should also be added.
. If no such match occurs, then the record is inserted in the intentions list based on the `type` field, and ordered according to the uid.
All of the records with the same type appear ordered in the intentions list.

`OTSAbstractRecord` is derived from `ArjunaSubtranAwareResource`.
Therefore, all instances of `OTSAbstractRecord` inherit the benefits of this interface.

== AtomicTransaction

In terms of the OTS, `AtomicTransaction` is the preferred interface to the OTS protocol engine.
It is equivalent to `CosTransactions::Current`, but with more emphasis on easing application development.
For example, if an instance of `AtomicTransaction` goes out of scope before it terminates, the transaction automatically rolls back.
`CosTransactions::Current` cannot provide this functionality.
When building applications using {parentProduct}, use `AtomicTransaction` for the added benefits it provides.
It is located in the `com.arjuna.ats.jts.extensions.ArjunaOTS` package.

.AtomicTransaction's Methods

|===
|`begin` |Starts an action
|`commit` |Commits an action
|`rollback` |Abort an action
|===

Transaction nesting is determined dynamically.
Any transaction started within the scope of another running transaction is nested.

The `TopLevelTransaction` class, which is derived from `AtomicTransaction`, allows creation of nested top-level transactions.
Such transactions allow non-serializable and potentially non-recoverable side effects to be initiated from within a transaction, so use them with caution.
You can create nested top-level transactions with a combination of the `CosTransactions::TransactionFactory` and the `suspend` and `resume` methods of `CosTransactions::Current`.
However, the `TopLevelTransaction` class provides a more user-friendly interface.

`AtomicTransaction` and `TopLevelTransaction` are completely compatible with `CosTransactions::Current`.
You an use the two transaction mechanisms interchangeably within the same application or object.

`AtomicTransaction` and `TopLevelTransaction` are similar to `CosTransactions::Current`.
They both simplify the interface between you and the OTS.
However, you gain two advantages by using `AtomicTransaction` or `TopLevelTransaction`.

* The ability to create nested top-level transactions which are automatically associated with the current thread.
When the transaction ends, the previous transaction associated with the thread, if any, becomes the thread’s current transaction.
* Instances of `AtomicTransaction` track scope, and if such an instance goes out of scope before it is terminated, it is automatically aborted, along with its children.

== Context propagation issues

When using TXOJ in a distributed manner, {parentProduct} requires you to use interposition between client and object.
This requirement also exists if the application is local, but the transaction manager is remote.
In the case of implicit context propagation, where the application object is derived from `CosTransactions::TransactionalObject`, you do not need to do anything further. {parentProduct} automatically provides interposition.
However, where implicit propagation is not supported by the ORB, or your application does not use it, you must take additional action to enable interposition.

The class `com.arjuna.ats.jts.ExplicitInterposition` allows an application to create a local control object which acts as a local coordinator, fielding registration requests that would normally be passed back to the originator.
This surrogate registers itself with the original coordinator, so that it can correctly participate in the commit protocol.
The application thread context becomes the surrogate transaction hierarchy.
Any transaction context currently associated with the thread is lost.
The interposition lasts for the lifetime of the explicit interposition object, at which point the application thread is no longer associated with a transaction context.
Instead, it is set to `null`.

interposition is intended only for those situations where the transactional object and the transaction occur within different processes, rather than being co-located.
If the transaction is created locally to the client, do not use the explicit interposition class.
The transaction is implicitly associated with the transactional object because it resides within the same process.

.ExplicitInterposition
====

----
include::{sourcedir}/extras/ExplicitInterposition.java[]

A transaction context can be propagated between client and server in two ways: either as a reference to the client’s transaction Control, or explicitly sent by the client.
Therefore, there are two ways in which the interposed transaction hierarchy can be created and registered.
For example, consider the class Example which is derived from LockManager and has a method increment:

.ExplicitInterposition Example
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/extras/ExplicitInterposition_example.java[]
----
====

if the `Control` passed to the `register` operation of `ExplicitInterposition` is `null`, no exception is thrown.
The system assumes that the client did not send a transaction context to the server.
A transaction created within the object will thus be a top-level transaction.

When the application returns, or when it finishes with the interposed hierarchy, the program should call `unregisterTransaction` to disassociate the thread of control from the hierarchy.
This occurs automatically when the `ExplicitInterposition` object is garbage collected.
However, since this may be after the transaction terminates, {parentProduct} assumes the thread is still associated with the transaction and issues a warning about trying to terminate a transaction while threads are still active within it.
