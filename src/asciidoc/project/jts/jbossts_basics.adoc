== {parentProduct} Basics

=== Introduction

{parentProduct} is based upon the original Arjuna system developed at the University of Newcastle between 1986 and 1995. Arjuna predates the OTS specification and includes many features not found in the OTS.
{parentProduct} is a superset of the OTS.
Applications written using the standard OTS interfaces are portable across OTS implementations.

* full draft 5 compliance, with support for Synchronization objects and PropagationContexts.
* support for subtransactions.
* implicit context propagation where support from the ORB is available.
* support for multi-threaded applications.
* fully distributed transaction managers, i.e., there is no central transaction manager, and the creator of a top-level transaction is responsible for its termination.
Separate transaction manager support is also available, however.
* transaction interposition.
* X/Open compliance, including checked transactions.
This checking can optionally be disabled.
Note: checked transactions are disabled by default, i.e., any thread can terminate a transaction.
* JDBC support.
* Full Jakarta Transactions support.

You can use {parentProduct} in three different levels, which correspond to the sections in this chapter, and are each explored in their own chapters as well.

Because of differences in ORB implementations, {parentProduct} uses a separate ORB Portability library which acts as an abstraction later.
Many of the examples used throughout this manual use this library.
Refer to the ORB Portability Manual for more details.

==== Raw OTS

The OTS is only a protocol engine for driving registered resources through a two-phase commit protocol.
You are responsible for building and registering the `Resource` objects which handle persistence and concurrency control, ensuring ACID properties for transactional application objects.
You need to register `Resources` at appropriate times, and ensure that a given `Resource` is only registered within a single transaction.
Programming at the raw OTS level is extremely basic.
You as the programmer are responsible for almost everything to do with transactions, including managing persistence and concurrency control on behalf of every transactional object.

==== Enhanced OTS functionality

The OTS implementation of nested transactions is extremely limited, and can lead to the generation of heuristic results.
An example of such a result is when a sub-transaction coordinator discovers part of the way through committing that some resources cannot commit, but being unable to tell the committed resources to abort. {parentProduct} allows nested transactions to execute a full two-phase commit protocol, which removes the possibility that some resources will comment while others roll back.

When resources are registered with a transaction, you have no control over the order in which these resources are invoked during the commit/abort protocol.
For example, if previously registered resources are replaced with newly registered resources, resources registered with a subtransaction are merged with the subtraction's parent. {parentProduct} provides an additional Resource subtype which you this level of control.

==== Advanced API

The OTS does not provide any `Resource` implementations.
You are responsible for implementing these interfaces.
The interfaces defined within the OTS specification are too low-level for most application programmers.
Therefore, {parentProduct} includes _Transactional Objects for Java (TXOJ)_ , which makes use of the raw Common Object Services interfaces but provides a higher-level API for building transactional applications and frameworks.
This API automates much of the activities concerned with participating in an OTS transaction, freeing you to concentrate on application development, rather than transactions.

The architecture of the system is shown in Figure 2. The API interacts with the concurrency control and persistence services, and automatically registers appropriate resources for transactional objects.
These resources may also use the persistence and concurrency services.

{parentProduct} exploits object-oriented techniques to provide you with a toolkit of Java classes which are inheritable by application classes, to obtain transactional properties.
These classes form a hierarchy, illustrated in link:#jbossts-class-hierarchy[{parentProduct} class hierarchy].

Your main responsibilities are specifying the scope of transactions and setting appropriate locks within objects. {parentProduct} guarantees that transactional objects will be registered with, and be driven by, the appropriate transactions.
Crash recovery mechanisms are invoked automatically in the event of failures.
When using the provided interfaces, you do not need to create or register `Resource` objects or call services controlling persistence or recovery.
If a transaction is nested, resources are automatically propagated to the transaction’s parent upon commit.

The design and implementation goal of {parentProduct} was to provide a programming system for constructing fault-tolerant distributed applications.
Three system properties were considered highly important:

|===
|Integration of Mechanisms |Fault-tolerant distributed systems require a variety of system functions for naming, locating and invoking operations upon objects, as well as for concurrency control, error detection and recovery from failures. These mechanisms are integrated in a way that is easy for you to use.
|Flexibility |Mechanisms must be flexible, permitting implementation of application-specific enhancements, such as type-specific concurrency and recovery control, using system defaults.
|Portability |You need to be able to run {parentProduct} on any ORB.
|===

{parentProduct} is implemented in Java and extensively uses the type-inheritance facilities provided by the language to provide user-defined objects with characteristics such as persistence and recoverability.

=== {parentProduct} and the OTS implementation

The OTS specification is written with flexibility in mind, to cope with different application requirements for transactions. {parentProduct} supports all optional parts of the OTS specification.
In addition, if the specification allows functionality to be implemented in a variety of different ways, {parentProduct} supports all possible implementations.

|===
|OTS specification |{parentProduct} default implementation
|If the transaction service chooses to restrict the availability of the transaction context, then it should raise the `Unavailable` exception. |{parentProduct} does not restrict the availability of the transaction context.
|An implementation of the transaction service need not initialize the transaction context for every request. |{parentProduct} only initializes the transaction context if the interface supported by the target object extends the `TransactionalObject` interface.
|An implementation of the transaction service may restrict the ability for the `Coordinator`, `Terminator`, and `Control` objects to be transmitted or used in other execution environments to enable it to guarantee transaction integrity. |{parentProduct} does not impose restrictions on the propagation of these objects.
|The transaction service may restrict the termination of a transaction to the client that started it. |{parentProduct} allows the termination of a transaction by any client that uses the `Terminator` interface. In addition, {parentProduct} does not impose restrictions when clients use the `Current` interface.
|A `TransactionFactory` is located using the `FactoryFinder` interface of the life-cycle service. |{parentProduct} provides multiple ways in which the `TransactionFactory` can be located.
|A transaction service implementation may use the Event Service to report heuristic decisions. |{parentProduct} does not use the Event Service to report heuristic decisions.
|An implementation of the transaction service does not need to support nested transactions. |{parentProduct} supports nested transactions.
|`Synchronization` objects must be called whenever the transaction commits. |{parentProduct} allows `Synchronizations` to be called no matter what state the transaction terminates with.
|A transaction service implementation is not required to support interposition. |{parentProduct} supports various types of interposition.

=== Thread class

{parentProduct} is fully multi-threaded and supports the OTS notion of allowing multiple threads to be active within a transaction, and for a thread to execute multiple transactions.
A thread can only be active within a single transaction at a time, however.
By default, if a thread is created within the scope of a transaction, the new thread is not associated with the transaction.
If the thread needs to be associated with the transaction, use the `resume` method of either the `AtomicTransaction` class or the `Current` class.

However, if newly created threads need to automatically inherit the transaction context of their parent, then they should extend the `OTS_Thread` class.

====
[source,Java]
----
public class OTS_Thread extends Thread {
    public void terminate ();
    public void run ();

    protected OTS_Thread ();
}

----
====

Call the `run` method of `OTS_Thread` at the start of the application thread class's `run` method.
Call `terminate` before you exit the body of the application thread’s `run` method.

=== ORB portability issues

Although the CORBA specification is a standard, it is written so that an ORB can be implemented in multiple ways.
As such, writing portable client and server code can be difficult.
Because {parentProduct} has been ported to most of the widely available ORBs, it includes a series of ORB Portability classes and macros.
If you write your application using these classes, it should be mostly portable between different ORBs.
These classes are described in the separate ORB Portability Manual.
