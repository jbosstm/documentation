= Web Service Transaction Service (XTS) Management

The basic building blocks of a transactional Web Services application include the application itself, the Web services that the application consumes, the Transaction Manager, and the transaction participants which support those Web services.
Although it is likely that different developers will be responsible for each piece, the concepts are presented here so that you can see the whole picture.
Often, developers produce services, or applications that consume services, and system administrators run the transaction-management infrastructure.

== Transaction manager overview

The transaction manager is a Web service which coordinates XTS transactions.
It is the only software component in XTS that is designed to be run directly as a network service, rather than to support end-user code.
The transaction manager runs as a JAXM request/response Web service.

[NOTE]
====
When starting up an application server instance that has XTS transaction manager deployed within it, you may see various `error` messages in the console or log.
For example, `16:53:38,850 ERROR [STDERR] Message Listener Service: started, message listener jndi name activationcoordinator`.
These are for information purposes only and are not actual errors.

== Configuring the transaction manager

You can configure the Transaction Manager and related infrastructure by using two properties files.
The `standalone-xts.xml` file contains the common configuration options.
More advanced options can be configured in the `xts-properties.xml_`.

[NOTE]
====
The XTS module (`modules/system/layers/base/org/jboss/xts/main/jbossxts-${XTS_VERSION}.jar`)
in the (appServer)
includes the configuration file, `xts-properties.xml`,
in the root of the jar.
These properties can be edited and then
re-packaged in the jar.
The changes will take affect on next boot of the (appServer).
====

== Deployment descriptors

In general, changing the contents of the various deployment descriptors used by XTS is not necessary.
However, if you do need to modify them they are all included in `modules/system/layers/base/org/jboss/xts/main/jbossxts-${XTS_VERSION}.jar`.
