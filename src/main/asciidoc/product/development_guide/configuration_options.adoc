= Configuration options

== Loading a configuration

Each module of the system contains a `module propertyManager` class, which provides static getter methods for one or more `name EnvironmentBean` classes.
An example is `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.commmon.arjPropertyManager`.
These environment beans are standard JavaBean containing properties for each configuration option in the system.
Typical usage is of the form:

[source,java]
----
include::{productSourceDir}/development_guide/extras/defaultTimeout.java[]
----

These beans are singletons, instantiated upon first access, using the following algorithm.

.Procedure: Algorithm for environment bean instantiation
. The properties are loaded and populated from a properties file named and located as follows:
+
** If the properties file name property `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.common.propertiesFile` is set, its value is used as the file name.
** If not, the default file name `jbossts-properties.xml` is used.
The definition of the used value can be found at Narayana distribution jar file under `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` at property `arjuna-properties-file`.
. The file thus named is searched for by, in order
. absolute path
. `user.dir`
. `user.home`
. `java.home`
. directories contained on the classpath
. a default file embedded in the product .jar file
+
if you use Narayana dependency `org.jboss.narayana.jts:narayana-jts-idlj` you can check the default properties settings https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/blob/master/ArjunaJTS/narayana-jts-idlj/src/main/resources/jbossts-properties.xml[
in the Narayana repository at github].
. The file is treated as being of standard https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html[java.util.Properties xml format] and loaded accordingly.
The `entry` names are of the form `EnvironmentBeanClass.propertyName`.
+
An example is `<entrykey="CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.commitOnePhase">YES</entry>`
+
In specific cases when you want to set properties on configuration beans other that the default bean instances the form is `EnvironmentBeanClass.<storeType>.propertyName`.
+
An example is `<entry key="ObjectStoreEnvironmentBean.communicationStore.objectStoreType">` `com.arjuna.ats.internal.arjuna.objectstore.VolatileStore</entry>`
+
[NOTE]
====
Valid values for Boolean properties are case-insensitive, and may be one of `NO`/`YES`, `FALSE`/`TRUE`, `OFF`/`ON`.
====
+
In the case of properties that take multiple values, they are white-space-delimited.

. After the file is loaded, it is cached and is not re-read until the JVM is restarted.
Changes to the properties file require a restart in order to take effect.
. After the properties are loaded, the EnvironmentBean is then inspected and, for each field, if the properties contains a matching key in the search order as follows, the `setter` method for that field is invoked with the value from the properties, or the system properties if different.
** `Fully.Qualified.NameEnvironmentBean.propertyName`
+
for example `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.common.CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.commitOnePhase`
** `NameEnvironmentBean.propertyName` (`this is the preferred form used in the properties file`)
+
for example `CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.commitOnePhase`
** the old `com.arjuna...` properties key defined at bean by annnotations `@PropertyPrefix` or `@FullPropertyName` ([replaceable]`deprecated, for backwards compatibility only`).
+
for example `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.commitOnePhase`
. The bean is then returned to the caller, which may further override values by calling setter methods.

The implementation reads most bean properties only once, as the consuming component or class is instantiated.
This usually happens the first time a transaction is run.
As a result, calling `setter` methods to change the value of bean properties while the system is running typically has no effect, unless it is done prior to any use of the transaction system.
Altered bean properties are not persisted back to the properties file.

You can configure the system using a bean wiring system such as JBoss Microcontainer or Spring.
Take care when instantiating beans, to obtain the singleton via the static getter (factory) method on the module property manager.
Using a new bean instantiated with the default constructor is ineffective, since it is not possible to pass this configured bean back to the property management system.
