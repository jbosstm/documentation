= General Transaction Issues

== Advanced transaction issues with ArjunaCore

Atomic actions (transactions) can be used by both application programmers and class developers.
Thus entire operations (or parts of operations) can be made atomic as required by the semantics of a particular operation.
This chapter will describe some of the more subtle issues involved with using transactions in general and ArjunaCore in particular.

Note: in the past ArjunaCore was also referred to as TxCore.

=== Checking transactions

In a multi-threaded application, multiple threads may be associated with a transaction during its lifetime, sharing the context.
In addition, it is possible that if one thread terminates a transaction, other threads may still be active within it.
In a distributed environment, it can be difficult to guarantee that all threads have finished with a transaction when it is terminated.
By default, ArjunaCore will issue a warning if a thread terminates a transaction when other threads are still active within it.
However, it will allow the transaction termination to continue.

Other solutions to this problem are possible.
One example would be to block the thread which is terminating the transaction until all other threads have disassociated themselves from the transaction context.
Therefore, ArjunaCore provides the `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.CheckedAction` class, which allows the thread or transaction termination policy to be overridden.
Each transaction has an instance of this class associated with it, and application programmers can provide their own implementations on a per transaction basis.

.Class `CheckedAction`
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/extras/CheckedAction.java[]
----

When a thread attempts to terminate the transaction and there are active threads within it, the system will invoke the `check` method on the transaction's _CheckedAction_ object.
The parameters to the check method are:

isCommit::
Indicates whether the transaction is in the process of committing or rolling back.

actUid::
The transaction identifier.

list::
A list of all of the threads currently marked as active within this transaction.

When `check` returns, the transaction termination will continue.
Obviously the state of the transaction at this point may be different from that when `check` was called, e.g., the transaction may subsequently have been committed.

A `CheckedAction` instance is created for each transaction.
As mentioned above, the default implementation simply issues warnings in the presence of multiple threads active on the transaction when it is terminated.
However, a different instance can be provided to each transaction in one of the following ways:

* Use the `setCheckedAction` method on the `BasicAction` instance.
* Define an implementation of the `CheckedActionFactory` interface, which has a single method `getCheckedAction` (`final Uid`txId`, `final String`actionType`) that returns a `CheckedAction`. The factory class name can then be provided to the Transaction Service at runtime by setting the `CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.checkedActionFactory` property.

=== Gathering statistics

By default, the Transaction Service does not maintain any history information about transactions.
However, by setting the `CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.enableStatistics` property variable to `YES`, the transaction service will maintain information about the number of transactions created, and their outcomes.
This information can be obtained during the execution of a transactional application via the `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.TxStats` class.

.Class `TxStats`
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/extras/TxStats.java[]
----

The class `ActionManager` gives further information about specific active transactions through the classes `getTimeAdded`, which returns the time (in milliseconds) when the transaction was created, and `inflightTransactions`, which returns the list of currently active transactions.

=== Asynchronously committing a transaction

By default, the Transaction Service executes the `commit` protocol of a top-level transaction in a synchronous manner.
All registered resources will be told to prepare in order by a single thread, and then they will be told to commit or rollback.
This has several possible disadvantages:

* In the case of many registered resources, the `prepare` operating can logically be invoked in parallel on each resource.
The disadvantage is that if an "early" resource in the list of registered resource forces a rollback during `prepare`, possibly many prepare operations will have been made needlessly.
* In the case where heuristic reporting is not required by the application, the second phase of the commit protocol can be done asynchronously, since its success or failure is not important.

Therefore, {productName} provides runtime options to enable possible threading optimisations.
By setting the `CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.asyncPrepare` environment variable to `YES`, during the `prepare` phase a separate thread will be created for each registered participant within the transaction.
By setting `CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.asyncCommit` to `YES`, a separate thread will be created to complete the second phase of the transaction if knowledge about heuristics outcomes is not required.

=== Transaction Logs

{productName} supports a number of different transaction log implementations.
They are outlined below.

==== The ActionStore

This is the original version of the transaction log as provided in prior releases.
It is simple but slow.
Each transaction has an instance of its own log and they are all written to the same location in the file system

==== The HashedActionStore

This implementation is based on the `ActionStore` but the individual logs are striped across a number of sub-directories to improve performance.
Check the Configuration Options table for how to configure the `HashedActionStore`.

==== LogStore

This implementation is based on a traditional transaction log.
All transaction states within the same process (VM instance) are written to the same log (file), which is an append-only entity.
When transaction data would normally be deleted, e.g., at the end of the transaction, a delete record is added to the log instead.
Therefore, the log just keeps growing.
Periodically a thread runs to prune the log of entries that have been deleted.

A log is initially given a maximum capacity beyond which it cannot grow.
Once this is reached the system will create a new log for transactions that could not be accommodated in the original log.
The new log and the old log are pruned as usual.
During the normal execution of the transaction system there may be an arbitrary number of log instances.
These should be garbage collected by the system (or the recovery sub-system) eventually.

Check the Configuration Options table for how to configure the LogStore.
