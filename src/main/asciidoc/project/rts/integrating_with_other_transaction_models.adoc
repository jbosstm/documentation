= Interoperating With Other Transaction Models

Narayana in general supports a number of different transaction models other than the one described in this book.
Of particular importance are the standard ones supported by the standards, namely JTA and Web Services Transactions.

== JTA Bridge

=== Inbound Bridge

REST-AT to JTA bridge (also called inbound bridge) allows JTA resources to be enlisted in REST-AT transaction.
Therefore, tools such as JPA and JMS can be used by JAX-RS endpoints and their XA resources will participate in the REST-AT transaction together with RESTful participants.

This functionality is provided by Wildfly RTS subsytem.
Therefore, modular dependency on org.jboss.narayana.rts has to be defined in deployment's manifest file.
In order to enable bridging, service writer has to annotate either JAX-RS resource class or specific JAX-RS resource method with one of two annotations: `jakarta.ejb.TransactionAttribute`, `jakarta.transaction.Transactional`.

[source,java]
----
@Path("/")
public class JAXRSResource {
    @GET
    public void get() {
    // Do work witout JTA.
    }

    @POST
    @TransactionAttribute
    public void post() {
    // Do work with JTA.
    }
}
----

[source,java]
----
@Path("/")
@Transactional
public class JAXRSResource {
    @GET
    public void get() {
    // Do work with JTA.
    }

    @POST
    public void post() {
    // Do work with JTA.
    }
}
----

REST-AT transaction context does not provide timeout.
When REST-AT transaction is bridged to JTA then the bridged JTA transaction is created with the default timeout defined by the container.

=== Outbound Bridge

Enabling RESTAT participants to participate in a JTA transaction.

[WARNING]
====
Outbound bridging is not currently implemented
====

== Web Services Transactions

WS includes two transaction models referred to as WSAT and WSBA.
WSAT integration with JTA is documented in the Transaction Bridging section of the product guide (`http://narayana.io/docs/product/index.html#txbridge`).
By using this bridge in conjunction with the RESTAT JTA bridge full interoperability between RESTAT and WSAT can be realised.

[NOTE]
====
RESTAT outbound bridging is not currently supported so interoperability is one way only.
