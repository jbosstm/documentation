= Transaction Model
:imagesdir: images

The REST Atomic Transaction (RESTAT) model uses a traditional two-phase commit protocol with the following optimizations:

* Presumed rollback: the transaction coordinator need not record information about the participants in stable storage until it decides to commit, i.e., until after the prepare phase has completed successfully.
A definitive answer that a transaction does not exist can be used to infer that it rolled back.
* One-phase: if the coordinator discovers that only a single participant is registered then it may omit the prepare phase.
* Read-only: a participant that is responsible for a service that did not modify any transactional data during the course of the transaction can indicate to the coordinator during prepare that it is a read-only participant and the coordinator can omit it from the second phase of the commit protocol.

== Architecture

The diagram below illustrates the various resources defined within the RESTAT protocol.
We shall discuss each of these in the following sections.

These components are enumerated below and discussed in the following sections:

* Transaction Manager: this is a factory resource that is responsible for creating new transactions.
Once created, the transaction manager has no further role to play in the life of the transaction.
* Transaction Coordinator: this is a specific resource for the transaction.
It drives the two-phase commit protocol and manages interactions with participants.
* Client: the user of transactions.
* Service: a transaction-aware service that performs work that may need to be coordinated with other such services elsewhere.
* Participant: a resource that manages the state changes performed by the service in the context of a transaction.
The participant is driven through two-phase commit by the coordinator.

== State Transitions

A transaction coordinator and two-phase participant go through the state transitions shown:

As such, all of the resources in the protocol have statuses that can be represented as one of these values.
Asking a resource to change its state from, say, Active to Committed, may drive it through all of the intermediate states and as a result trigger protocol specific events, such as driving the two-phase commit protocol.

== The Transaction Manager Resource

The transaction manager is represented by a URI (referred to as the _transaction-manager_ URI).
It enables clients to create new transaction resources and to query the list of current transactions.
The actual URI depends upon how RESTAT is deployed and will be discussed later.
