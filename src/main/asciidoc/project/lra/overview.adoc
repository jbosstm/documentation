= Overview

This guide describes the Naryana implementation, or Naryana LRA for short, of the MicroProfile LRA specification https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-lra-spec.adoc The specification introduces annotations and APIs for services to coordinate long running activities whilst still maintaining loose coupling and doing so in such a way as to guarantee a globally consistent outcome without the need to take locks on data for extended periods.
The specification has similarities to WS-BA except that it uses a simplified compensation model and as such it can expose certain failure conditions that are not present in WS-BA.
Please refer to https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-lra-spec.adoc#the-model for details of the state model used by the LRA specification.

The basic idea is to group a collection of compensatable JAX-RS service interactions within a context, called a Long Running Action (LRA).
The context is propagated on JAX-RS service requests and responses using a JAX-RS header.
The implementation automatically adds the header to requests and responses before and after service method invocation (using JAX-RS filters as an implementation technique).
An attribute of the @LRA annotation determines how the LRA is started and/or ended.

A service may join the context by, in the case of a JAX-RS resource, providing REST endpoints (via annotations) that the implementation should invoke when the LRA is later closed or cancelled.
The specification is transactional in the sense that all the endpoints involved in the interaction are informed about the decision to close or cancel the context regardless of system failures.
