To upgrade to the latest version of the {productName} software, replace all currently used {productName} jars with their latest versions.
However, before replacing the jars, ensure that all pending transactions are either completed or recovered.
It is essential that the Object Store is empty before transitioning to a newer version of {productName}.
This precaution is necessary because a newer version of {productName} may potentially break compatibility with older information stored in the Object Store, making that data unusable.
