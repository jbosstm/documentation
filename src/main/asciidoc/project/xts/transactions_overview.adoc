= Transactions Overview

[NOTE]
====
This chapter deals with the theory of transactional Web Services.
If you are familiar with these principles, consider this chapter a reference.
====

Transactions have emerged as the dominant paradigm for coordinating interactions between parties in a distributed system, and in particular to manage applications that require concurrent access to shared data.
Much of the XTS API is based on contemporary transaction APIs whose familiarity will enhance developer productivity and lessen the learning curve.
While the following section provides the essential information that you should know before starting to use XTS for building transactional Web Services, it should not be treated as a definitive reference to all transactional technology.

A transaction is a unit of work that encapsulates multiple database actions such that that either all the encapsulated actions fail or all succeed.

Transactions ensure data integrity when an application interacts with multiple datasources.

The main components involved in using and defining transactional Web Services using XTS are illustrated in <<fig_web_services_transaction>>.

== The Coordinator

Every transaction is associated with a coordinator, which is responsible for governing the outcome of the transaction.
When a client begins a Web Service transaction it posts a _create_ request to a coordination service, which creates the coordinator and returns its details to the client.
This service may be located in its own container or may be colocated with the application client or with one of the transactional web services for improved performance.
The coordination service is typically responsible for managing many transactions in parallel, so each coordinator is identified by a unique transaction identifier.

The coordinator is responsible for ensuring that the web services invoked by the client arrive at a consistent outcome.
When the client asks the coordinator to complete the transaction, the coordinator ensures that each web service is ready to confirm any provisional changes it has made within the scope of the transaction.
It then asks them all to make their changes permanent.
If any of the web services indicates a problem at the confirmation stage, the coordinator ensures that all web services reject their provisional changes, reverting to the state before the transaction started.
The coordinator also reverts all changes if the client asks it to cancel the transaction.

The negotiation between the coordinator and the web services is organized to ensure that all services will make their changes permanent, or all of them will revert to the previous state, even if the coordinator or one of the web services crashes part of the way through the transaction."

== The Transaction Context

In order for a transaction to span a number of services, certain information has to be shared between those services, to propagate information about the transaction.
This information is known as the _Context_.
The coordination service hands a context back to the application client when it begins a transaction.
This context is passed as an extra, hidden parameter whenever the client invokes a transactional web service.
The XTS implementation saves and propagates this context automatically with only minimal involvement required on the part of the client.
However, it is still helpful to understand what information is captured in a context.
This information is listed in the following section.

.Contents of a Context
Transaction Identifier::
Guarantees global uniqueness for an individual transaction.

Transaction Coordinator Location::
The endpoint address participants contact to enroll.

== Participants

The coordinator cannot know the details of how every transactional service is implemented.
In fact this knowledge is not even necessary for it to negotiate a transactional outcome.
It treats each service taking part in a transaction as a participant and communicates with it according to some predefined participant coordination models appropriate to the type of transaction.
When a web service receives its first service request in some given transaction, it enrolls with the coordinator as a participant, specifying the participant model it wishes to follow.
The context contains a URL for the endpoint of the coordination service which handles enrollment requests.
So, the term participant merely refers a transactional service enrolled in a specific transaction using a specific participant model.

== ACID Transactions

Traditionally, transaction processing systems support _ACID_ properties.
ACID is an acronym for _A_ tomic, _C_ onsistent, _I_ solated, and _D_ urable.
A unit of work has traditionally been considered transactional only if the ACID properties are maintained, as describe in <<acid_properties>>.

[[acid_properties]]
.ACID Properties
Atomicity::
The transaction executes completely, or not at all.

Consistency::
The effects of the transaction preserve the internal consistency of an underlying data structure.

Isolated::
The transaction runs as if it were running alone, with no other transactions running, and is not visible to other transactions.

Durable::
The transaction's results are not lost in the event of a failure.

== Two Phase Commit

The classical two-phase commit approach is the bedrock of {productName}, and more generally of Web Services transactions.
Two-phase commit provides coordination of parties that are involved in a transaction.
The general flow of a two-phase commit transaction is described in <<two_phase_commit_overview>>.

[[two_phase_commit_overview]]
.Two-Phase Commit Overview

[NOTE]
====
During two-phase commit transactions, coordinators and resources keep track of activity in non-volatile data stores so that they can recover in the case of a failure.
====

== The Synchronization Protocol

Besides the two-phase commit protocol, traditional transaction processing systems employ an additional protocol, often referred to as the _synchronization protocol_.
With the original ACID properties, Durability is important when state changes need to be available despite failures.
Applications interact with a persistence store of some kind, such as a database, and this interaction can impose a significant overhead, because disk access is much slower to access than main computer memory.

One solution to the problem disk access time is to cache the state in main memory and only operate on the cache for the duration of a transaction.
Unfortunately, this solution needs a way to flush the state back to the persistent store before the transaction terminates, or risk losing the full ACID properties.
This is what the synchronization protocol does, with _Synchronization Participants_.

Synchronizations are informed that a transaction is about to commit.
At that point, they can flush cached state, which might be used to improve performance of an application, to a durable representation prior to the transaction committing.
The synchronizations are then informed about when the transaction completes and its completion state.

.Procedure: The "Four Phase Protocol" Created By Synchronizations
Synchronizations essentially turn the two-phase commit protocol into a four-phase protocol:
. Before the transaction starts the two-phase commit, all registered Synchronizations are informed.
Any failure at this point will cause the transaction to roll back.
. The coordinator then conducts the normal two-phase commit protocol.
. Once the transaction has terminated, all registered Synchronizations are informed.
However, this is a courtesy invocation because any failures at this stage are ignored: the transaction has terminated so there's nothing to affect.

The synchronization protocol does not have the same failure requirements as the traditional two-phase commit protocol.
For example, Synchronization participants do not need the ability to recover in the event of failures, because any failure before the two-phase commit protocol completes cause the transaction to roll back, and failures after it completes have no effect on the data which the Synchronization participants are responsible for.

== Optimizations to the Protocol

There are several variants to the standard two-phase commit protocol that are worth knowing about, because they can have an impact on performance and failure recovery.
<<xts_two_phase_variants>> gives more information about each one.

[[xts_two_phase_variants]]
.Variants to the Two-Phase Commit Protocol
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Variant |Description
|Presumed Abort |If a transaction is going to roll back, the coordinator may record this information locally and tell all enlisted participants.
Failure to contact a participant has no effect on the transaction outcome.
The coordinator is informing participants only as a courtesy.
Once all participants have been contacted, the information about the transaction can be removed.
If a subsequent request for the status of the transaction occurs, no information will be available and the requester can assume that the transaction has aborted.
This optimization has the benefit that no information about participants need be made persistent until the transaction has progressed to the end of the `prepare` phase and decided to commit, since any failure prior to this point is assumed to be an abort of the transaction.
|One-Phase |If only a single participant is involved in the transaction, the coordinator does not need to drive it through the `prepare` phase.
Thus, the participant is told to commit, and the coordinator does not need to record information about the decision, since the outcome of the transaction is the responsibility of the participant.
|Read-Only |When a participant is asked to prepare, it can indicate to the coordinator that no information or data that it controls has been modified during the transaction.
Such a participant does not need to be informed about the outcome of the transaction since the fate of the participant has no affect on the transaction.
Therefore, a read-only participant can be omitted from the second phase of the commit protocol.

[NOTE]
====
The WS-Atomic Transaction protocol does not support the one-phase commit optimisation.

== Non-Atomic Transactions and Heuristic Outcomes

In order to guarantee atomicity, the two-phase commit protocol is _blocking_.
As a result of failures, participants may remain blocked for an indefinite period of time, even if failure recovery mechanisms exist.
Some applications and participants cannot tolerate this blocking.

To break this blocking nature, participants that are past the _prepare_ phase are allowed to make autonomous decisions about whether to commit or rollback.
Such a participant must record its decision, so that it can complete the original transaction if it eventually gets a request to do so.
If the coordinator eventually informs the participant of the transaction outcome, and it is the same as the choice the participant made, no conflict exists.
If the decisions of the participant and coordinator are different, the situation is referred to as a non-atomic outcome, and more specifically as a _heuristic outcome_.

Resolving and reporting heuristic outcomes to the application is usually the domain of complex, manually driven system administration tools, because attempting an automatic resolution requires semantic information about the nature of participants involved in the transactions.

Precisely when a participant makes a heuristic decision depends on the specific implementation.
Likewise, the choice the participant makes about whether to commit or to roll back depends upon the implementation, and possibly the application and the environment in which it finds itself.
The possible heuristic outcomes are discussed in <<tbl_heuristic_outcomes>>.

.Heuristic Outcomes
[[tbl_heuristic_outcomes]]
[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Outcome |Description
|Heuristic Rollback |The commit operation failed because some or all of the participants unilaterally rolled back the transaction.
|Heuristic Commit |An attempted rollback operation failed because all of the participants unilaterally committed.
One situation where this might happen is if the coordinator is able to successfully `prepare` the transaction, but then decides to roll it back because its transaction log could not be updated.
While the coordinator is making its decision, the participants decide to commit.
|Heuristic Mixed |Some participants committed, while others were rolled back.
|Heuristic Hazard |The disposition of some of the updates is unknown.
For those which are known, they have either all been committed or all rolled back.
|===

Heuristic decisions should be used with care and only in exceptional circumstances, since the decision may possibly differ from that determined by the transaction service.
This type of difference can lead to a loss of integrity in the system.
Try to avoid needing to perform resolution of heuristics, either by working with services and participants that do not cause heuristics, or by using a transaction service that provides assistance in the resolution process.

== Interposition

_Interposition_ is a scoping mechanism which allows coordination of a transaction to be delegated across a hierarchy of coordinators.
See <<fig_interpositions>> for a graphical representation of this concept.

[[fig_interpositions]]
.Interpositions
image::../images/xts-fig-interpositions.png[align="center"]

Interposition is particularly useful for Web Services transactions, as a way of limiting the amount of network traffic required for coordination.
For example, if communications between the top-level coordinator and a web service are slow because of network traffic or distance, the web service might benefit from executing in a subordinate transaction which employs a local coordinator service.
In <<fig_interpositions>>,to _prepare_ , the top-level coordinator only needs to send one _prepare_ message to the subordinate coordinator, and receive one _prepared_ or _aborted_ reply.
The subordinate coordinator forwards a _prepare_ locally to each participant and combines the results to decide whether to send a single _prepared_ or _aborted_ reply.

== A New Transaction Protocol

Many component technologies offer mechanisms for coordinating ACID transactions based on two-phase commit semantics.
Some of these are CORBA/OTS, JTS/JTA, and MTS/MSDTC.
ACID transactions are not suitable for all Web Services transactions, as explained in the following section.

.Reasons ACID is Not Suitable for Web Services

* Classic ACID transactions assume that an organization that develops and deploys applications owns the entire infrastructure for the applications.
This infrastructure has traditionally taken the form of an Intranet.
Ownership implies that transactions operate in a trusted and predictable manner.
To assure ACIDity, potentially long-lived locks can be kept on underlying data structures during two-phase commit.
Resources can be used for any period of time and released when the transaction is complete.
+
In Web Services, these assumptions are no longer valid.
One obvious reason is that the owners of data exposed through a Web service refuse to allow their data to be locked for extended periods, since allowing such locks invites denial-of-service attacks.
* All application infrastructures are generally owned by a single party.
Systems using classical ACID transactions normally assume that participants in a transaction will obey the directives of the transaction manager and only infrequently make unilateral decisions which harm other participants in a transaction.
+
Web Services participating in a transaction can effectively decide to resign from the transaction at any time, and the consumer of the service generally has little in the way of quality of service guarantees to prevent this.

=== Transaction in Loosely Coupled Systems

Extended transaction models which relax the ACID properties have been proposed over the years.
WS-T provides a new transaction protocol to implement these concepts for the Web Services architecture.
XTS is designed to accommodate four underlying requirements inherent in any loosely coupled architecture like Web Services.
These requirements are discussed in the following section.

.Requirements of Web Services

* Ability to handle multiple successful outcomes to a transaction, and to involve operations whose effects may not be isolated or durable.
* Coordination of autonomous parties whose relationships are governed by contracts, rather than the dictates of a central design authority.
* Discontinuous service, where parties are expected to suffer outages during their lifetimes, and coordinated work must be able to survive such outages.
* Interoperation using XML over multiple communication protocols.
XTS uses SOAP encoding carried over HTTP.
