= Constructing a Transactional Objects for Java application

== Development Phases of a ArjunaCore Application

. First, develop new classes with characteristics like persistence, recoverability, and concurrency control.
. Then develop the applications that make use of the new classes of objects.

Although these two phases may be performed in parallel and by a single person, this guide refers to the first step as the job of the class developer, and the second as the job of the applications developer.
The class developer defines appropriate `save_state` and `restore_state` operations for the class, sets appropriate locks in operations, and invokes the appropriate ArjunaCore class constructors.
The applications developer defines the general structure of the application, particularly with regard to the use of atomic actions.

This chapter outlines a simple application, a simple FIFO Queue class for integer values.
The Queue is implemented with a doubly linked list structure, and is implemented as a single object.
This example is used throughout the rest of this manual to illustrate the various mechanisms provided by ArjunaCore.
Although this is an unrealistic example application, it illustrates all of the ArjunaCore modifications without requiring in depth knowledge of the application code.

[NOTE]
====
The application is assumed not to be distributed.
To allow for distribution, context information must be propagated either implicitly or explicitly.

== Queue description

The queue is a traditional FIFO queue, where elements are added to the front and removed from the back.
The operations provided by the queue class allow the values to be placed on to the queue (`enqueue`) and to be removed from it (`dequeue`), and values of elements in the queue can also be changed or inspected.
In this example implementation, an array represents the queue.
A limit of `QUEUE_SIZE` elements has been imposed for this example.

== Constructors and finalizers

Using an existing persistent object requires the use of a special constructor that takes the Uid of the persistent object, as shown in <<_example_transactionalqueue>> .

The use of an atomic action within the constructor for a new object follows the guidelines outlined earlier and ensures that the objectâ€™s state will be written to the object store when the appropriate top level atomic action commits (which will either be the action A or some enclosing action active when the TransactionalQueue was constructed).
The use of atomic actions in a constructor is simple: an action must first be declared and its begin operation invoked; the operation must then set an appropriate lock on the object (in this case a WRITE lock must be acquired), then the main body of the constructor is executed.
If this is successful the atomic action can be committed, otherwise it is aborted.

The finalizer of the `queue` class is only required to call the `terminate` and `finalizer` operations of `LockManager`.

== Required methods

=== `save_state`, `restore_state`, and `type`

.Method `type`

Because the Queue class is derived from the LockManager class, the operation type should be:

=== `enqueue`and `dequeue` methods

If the operations of the `queue` class are to be coded as atomic actions, then the enqueue operation might have the structure given below.
The `dequeue` operation is similarly structured, but is not implemented here.

.Method `enqueue`

=== `queueSize` method

=== `inspectValue` and `setValue` methods

[NOTE]
====
The `setValue` method is not implemented here, but is similar in structure to <<example_queue_inspectvalue>> .

== The client

Rather than show all of the code for the client, this example concentrates on a representative portion.
Before invoking operations on the object, the client must first bind to the object.
In the local case this simply requires the client to create an instance of the object.

== Comments

Since the _queue_ object is persistent, the state of the object survives any failures of the node on which it is located.
The state of the object that survives is the state produced by the last top-level committed atomic action performed on the object.
If an application intends to perform two `enqueue` operations atomically, for example, you can nest the `enqueue` operations in another enclosing atomic action.
In addition, concurrent operations on such a persistent object are serialized, preventing inconsistencies in the state of the object.

However, since the elements of the _queue_ objects are not individually concurrency controlled, certain combinations of concurrent operation invocations are executed serially, even though logically they could be executed concurrently.
An example of this is modifying the states of two different elements in the queue.
The platform Development Guide addresses some of these issues.
