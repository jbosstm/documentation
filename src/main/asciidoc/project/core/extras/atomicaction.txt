< create a collection containing all transactions currently in the log >

Second Pass:
while < there are transactions in the collection >
do
 if < the intention list for the transaction still exists >
 then
   < create new transaction cached item >
   < obtain the status of the transaction >
 
   if < the transaction is not in progress (ie phase 2 has finished ) >
   then
     < replay phase two of the commit protocol >
