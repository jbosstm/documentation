== JacORB

Take care to use only the patched version of JacORB shipped with {parentProduct}.
Correct functioning of the transaction system, particularly with regard to crash recovery, is unlikely to work with an unpatched JacORB.
For each deployment of JacORB, ensure that the `jacorb.implname` in the `jacorb.properties` file is unique.
