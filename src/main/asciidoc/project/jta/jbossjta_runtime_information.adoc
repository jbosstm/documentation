= {productName} Runtime Information

Compile-time configuration information is available via class `com.arjuna.common.util.ConfigurationInfo`.
Runtime configuration is embodied in the various `name EnvironmentBean` classes where name refers to the particular configuration category (see the configuration section of the user guide).
These beans have corresponding MBean interfaces and may be linked to JMX for remote inspection of the configuration if desired.
