= Preparing Your System

== Pre-Installation Steps

Before installing the {productName} software, we recommend the following administrative steps be taken, assuming a default configuration for {productName}.

[arabic]
. Install the distribution into the required location.
+
Typically, the distribution is extracted from a `.ZIP` file.
. Specify the Location for the Object Store
+
{productName} requires a minimum object store for storing the outcome of transactions in the event of system crashes.
The location of this should be specified in the properties file using the `ObjectStoreEnvironmentBean.objectStoreDir` key or by using environment variable:
+
[source,shell]
----
java â€“DObjectStoreEnvironmentBean.objectStoreDir =C:\temp foo.
----
. Optional: Specify the sub-directory within the Object Store root.
+
By default, all object states will be stored within the `defaultStore` sub-directory of the object store root.
For instance, if the object store root is `/usr/local/Arjuna/TransactionService/ObjectStore`, the subdirectory `/usr/local/Arjuna/TransactionService/ObjectStore/defaultStore/` is used.
+
To change this subdirectory, set the `ObjectStoreEnvironmentBean.localOSRoot` or `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.objectstore.localOSRoot` property variable accordingly.
