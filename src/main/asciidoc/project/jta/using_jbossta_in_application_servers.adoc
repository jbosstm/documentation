= Using &PRODUCT;in application servers

{appServer} is discussed here.
Refer to the documentation for your application server for differences.

== Configuration

When {productName} runs embedded in {appServer}, the transaction subsystem is configured primarily through the `jboss-cli` configuration tool, which overrides properties read from the default properties file embedded in the `.jar` file.

.Common configuration attributes
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|default-timeout |The default transaction timeout to be used for new transactions. Specified as an integer in seconds.
|enable-statistics |This determines whether or not the transaction service should gather statistical information. This information can then be viewed using the `TransactionStatistics` MBean. Specified as a Boolean. The default is to not gather this information.
|===

See the `jboss-cli` tool and the {appServer} administration and configuration guide for further information.

== Logging

To make {parentProduct} logging semantically consistent with {appServer}, the `TransactionManagerService` modifies the level of some log messages, by overriding the value of the `LoggingEnvironmentBean.loggingFactory` property in the `jbossts-properties.xml` file.
Therefore, the value of this property has no effect on the logging behavior when running embedded in {appServer}.
By forcing use of the `log4j_releveler` logger, the TransactionManagerService changes the level of all `INFO` level messages in the transaction code to `DEBUG`.
Therefore, these messages do not appear in log files if the filter level is `INFO`.
All other log messages behave as normal.

== The services

The `TransactionManager` bean provides transaction management services to other components in {appServer}.
There are two different version of this bean and they require different configuration.
Use `jboss-cli` to select JTA or JTS mode.

== Ensuring transactional context is propagated to the server

You can coordinate transactions from a coordinator which is not located within the {appServer}, such as when using transactions created by an external OTS server.
To ensure the transaction context is propagated via JRMP invocations to the server, the transaction propagation context factory needs to be explicitly set for the JRMP invoker proxy.
This is done as follows:

[source,java]
----
JRMPInvokerProxy.setTPCFactory(new com.arjuna.ats.internal.jbossatx.jts.PropagationContextManager());
----
