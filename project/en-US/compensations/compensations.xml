  <title>Compensating transactions</title>
  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      Compensating transactions are acknowledged as a good fit for long lived transactions.
      The idea comes out of (<ulink url="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/cs711/2002fa/reading/sagas.pdf">the Sagas paper, Princeton University, 1987</ulink>).
      The concept of the original paper talks about a single node database but the concepts described can readily be applied to distributed transactions.
    </para>
    <para>
      Structurally, applications utilising Sagas may consist of several atomic transactions each working with a separate system
      and with corresponding compensation handlers to deal with failures. The Saga as a whole then presents an atomic work of unit
      where changes made by atomic transactions are visible immediately but in the case of failure a recovery handling is employed.
      As such, saga transactions can cooperate with, but don’t mandate full ACID - within that model, they would be considered as relaxing
      the isolation property.

    </para>
    <para>
      Compensating transaction fall within backward recovery. The compensation transaction is defined as a work of unit that consists
      from one or more actions. Each action processes some work and up to that provides compensation handler with the definition
      of the undo-like operation. When a failure occurs the transaction manager invokes the compensating handlers (the undo operation)
      to allow the application to reconcile work processed by the proper action.

      With regards to Narayana, and when considering its impact on the CAP theorem
      <ulink url="http://www.julianbrowne.com/article/viewer/brewers-cap-theorem">CAP theorem</ulink> which dictates us that because of network
      can’t be considered reliable we need to choose between one of availability or consistency, our compensations approach relaxes
      some degree of availability.

    <title>Compensations Framework</title>
    <para>
      Narayana contains a compensations framework to assist users with developing transactional applications
      which require the use of compensating transactions. The compensating transaction behaviour can be expressed
      using either CDI annotations or via a programmatic API.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>CDI annotations</title>
      <para>
        Application developer annotates methods with the CDI annotations to define actions and undo operations
        which are managed by Transaction Manager. Narayana handles the state of the compensating transaction and drives
        undo operation if necessary. The manner how the annotations are used is pretty similar to standard CDI transaction
        annotations (e.g. in Jakarta EE).
      </para>
      <para>
        For the better understanding we recommend to check the
        <ulink url="https://github.com/jbosstm/quickstart/tree/master/compensating-transactions/mongodb-simple">compensating transactions quickstart</ulink>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The “entry point” is marking a method with <code>@Compensatable</code> annotation. This defines demarcation for the compensating transaction
        to start a new one, to join to an existing one or to throw exception if a compensating transaction context does not yet exist
        - the behaviour is the same as you can know from with the Jakarta EE
        <code><ulink url="https://javadoc.io/static/jakarta.platform/jakarta.jakartaee-api/10.0.0/jakarta/ejb/TransactionAttribute.html">@TransactionAttribute</ulink></code>.
        On top of that the <code>@Compensatable</code> annotation permits you to define which exception type made the transaction to be cancelled
        or not cancelled.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the compensating transaction context exists there you can call methods marked with <code>@TxCompensate</code> and <code>@TxConfirm</code>
        annotations. Both expected to be parameterized with a handler class. That’s a class implementing either
        <code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.CompensationHandler</code>
        (with definition of one method called <code>compensate</code>) or <code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.ConfirmationHandler</code>
        (with definition of one method called <code>confirm</code>). Handlers intercepts the execution when the transaction reaches a specific state
        - the compensate method is called when it fails or is cancelled, the confirm method is called when it ends successfully.
      </para>
      <para>
        The CDI bean marking a method with <code>@TxCompensate</code>/<code>@TxConfirm</code> and the handlers can inject
        (<ulink url="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/3.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-3.0.html#built_in_annotation_literals">@Inject</ulink>)
        a POJO object (a DTO) marked as <code>@CompensationScoped</code>. This annotation defines the data being set to this object
        in the bean in the scope of the specific compensating transaction will be available in the handlers
        (<code>@TxCompensate</code>/<code>@TxConfirm</code>) intercepting the compensating transaction.
        It’s important the <code>@CompensationScoped</code> POJOs being implemented as
        <code><ulink url="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html">Serializable</ulink></code>
        as they are saved during transaction processing to the transaction log store. Let’s imagine a situation where some part
        of the compensating transaction work is processed and JVM, where Narayana transaction manager resides, is crashed.
        After the restart Narayana needs to understand the state before the crash. That information is persisted in the transaction log store.
        Narayana loads the POJO state and passes it to handlers - to get proceed with confirmation or compensation.

              <code>@Compensatable</code> - declaratively control compensation transaction boundaries on CDI managed beans.
              This is similar to what is known from Jakarta EE world, how <ulink url="https://javadoc.io/static/jakarta.platform/jakarta.jakartaee-api/10.0.0/jakarta/ejb/TransactionAttribute.html">@TransactionAttribute</ulink> drives
              the global transaction behaviour. Compensatable framework uses CDI (you can define how interacts
              with other compensating transaction in the scope - you can use the type as known from Jakarta EE,
              which means <code>MANDATORY</code>, <code>SUPPORTS</code>, <code>REQUIRED</code> etc.)

              of <code>@Compensatable</code> set with <code>RuntimeException</code>. There is no timeout associated with compensatable
              units of work which implies that they must either run to completion or fail.

        <title>Programmatic API</title>
        <para>
          The compensation framework provides a declarative API to add compensatable work and let it processed by framework.
          The application programmer injects the interface <code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.CompensatableAction</code>
          (<code>@Inject CompensatableAction</code>). This interface contains methods to add work to the action (<code>addWork</code>)
          and then execute the action <code>execute</code>).
        </para>
        <para>
          Programmer then adds work items to the <code>CompensatableAction</code> one by one.
          The <code>addWork</code> methods offers ability to specify work item, which is instance of <code>CompensatableWork</code> that declares
          only that the work has to define method to execute the work, and assign to the work item
          its <code>CompensationHandler</code> and/or <code>ConfirmationHandler</code>.
        </para>
        <para>
          The programmer then declares the instant when <code>CompensatableAction</code> should be executed by calling the method executes.
          Execution means that work items will be executed one by one. All work items then belong under the the same compensation
          and in the case of failure of one item others will be compensated (of a compensation handler was declared).
        </para>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Recovery</title>
      <para>
        Implementation of recovery for compensating transaction is not yet part of the Narayana codebase, see
        <ulink url="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-1107">https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-1099</ulink> however the implementation
        is under the review.
      </para>
      <para>
        The recovery works in the following way. The state of participant is saved to Narayana object store
        (<code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.internal.ParticipantImpl</code>). The content of the store regarding of the participant
        of the compensating transaction is <code>transactionId</code>, <code>participantId</code>, <code>compensationHandler</code>
        and <code>confirmationHandler</code>. For handler could be persisted it needs to implement <code>java.io.Serializable</code> interface.
      </para>
      <para>
        When crash of the Narayana occurs these data is restored and used during standard periodic recovery process.
        For restoring handlers user has to register an implementation of interface <code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.Deserializer</code>.
        The implementation is then used for getting implementation of the handler class which could be later used during recovery.
      </para>
      <para>
        For tracking state is used standard Narayana object store and its handling of <code>com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.StateManager</code>
        methods <code>save_state</code>. Narayana manages serializing and deserializing but programmer has to implement
        and registered the <code>Deserializer</code> interface to get handlers restored from the object store.

      <title>Limitation</title>
      <para>
        Currently there is one limitation which is needed to be emphasized. If you are used to work with XTS AT transactions
        you probably take advantage of transaction bridge functionality - ability of smoothly join XTS transaction with app server
        container transaction under one transparent global transaction. This is not possible for compensating transaction.
        The lack of the bridge functionality for the compensating transactions is addressed under jira
